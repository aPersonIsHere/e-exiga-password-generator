# e-exiga-password-generator
The Git Repository for Emmanuel Exiga's Password Generator.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to challenge my knowledge in JavaScript to create a password generator with safe-guards against incorrect inputs, toggleable options, and adjusting a list to the options to create a randomly generated password based off of the user's pasword length input. The site also uses prompts, alerts, and confirm pop-up boxes to alert the user of changes and warnings. Password generators should be simple and easy to use.

# How To Use the Site

Click on the button "Generate Password." Next, enter a number in range of 8 to 120. The program will remove decimals and verify that the user did not enter an incorrect response. If so, an error will pop-up. Otherwise, the user will need to confirm if the input length is correct as it is possible to mistype a number. Hit 'Ok' if it is correct.

Now, confirm boxes will appear and ask if the password required needs the option toggled or not for each character set in order: lowercase, UPPERCASE, numbers, and special characters. If none are toggled, an error is thrown, as a password cannot be generated with no character set selected.

Finally, you may screenshot or copy the password by highlighting the mouse over the text and copying it. If multiple passwords are needed, the instructions above must be repeated for each new password.
